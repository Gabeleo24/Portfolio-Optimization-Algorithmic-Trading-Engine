# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

Create a new repository on GitHub:
Go to GitHub and log in.
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
Name your repository (e.g., Portfolio-Optimization-Algorithmic-Trading-Engine).
You can add a description if you like.
Choose whether it should be public or private.
Important: Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license if you already have these files in your project (which you do). You'll be pushing your existing files.
Click "Create repository."
Initialize Git in your project folder:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of your project (the folder containing package.json, src, etc.).
Run the command: git init
Add your project files to the Git repository:
Run: git add . (This adds all files in the current directory and subdirectories.)
Commit your files:
Run: git commit -m "Initial commit of QuantPulse project"
Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository:
On your new GitHub repository page, you'll see a URL under "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before." It will look something like https://github.com/Gabeleo24/Portfolio-Optimization-Algorithmic-Trading-Engine.git. Copy this URL.
In your terminal, run: git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL (Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL with the URL you copied).
Verify the remote:
Run: git remote -v (You should see your GitHub repository URL listed for origin).
Push your code to GitHub:
Run: git push -u origin main (If your default branch is named master instead of main, use git push -u origin master).
After these steps, your project code should be uploaded to your GitHub repository.

If you need help with any code changes within the app as you're setting this up, or if you have other questions about the app's code, feel free to ask!
